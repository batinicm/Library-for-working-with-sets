# Library-for-working-with-sets
Implementation of a library designed for working with sets.

Written in C++.
Consists of implementations of fundamental set operations such as formation, search, insertion and removal. Additional operation includes intersection. Sets can be represented in two different ways: as singly linked lists and binary search trees.
Additionally provides the possibility of performance comparison, depending on the representation.

Includes a system of classes designed for working with sets, with independent realization of data structures, 
as the task excluded working with standard libraries such as STL. No recursion was allowed either, so algorithms
were completed iteratively, with the usage of stack.
